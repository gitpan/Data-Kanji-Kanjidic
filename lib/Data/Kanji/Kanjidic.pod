=head1 NAME

Data::Kanji::Kanjidic - parse the "kanjidic" kanji data file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Kanji::Kanjidic 'parse_kanjidic';
    my $kanji = parse_kanjidic ('/path/to/kanjidic');
    for my $k (keys %$kanji) {
        print "$k has radical number $kanji->{$k}{B}.\n";
    }


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parse_kanjidic

    my $kanjidic = parse_kanjidic ('kanjidic');

The input is the file name where Kanjidic may be found. The return
value is a hash reference. The keys of this hash reference are kanji,
encoded as Unicode. Each of the values of the hash reference are
entries corresponding to the kanji in the keys. Each value represents
one line of Kanjidic. Each is a hash reference, with the keys
described in L</parse_entry>.

This function assumes that the kanjidic file is encoded using the
EUC-JP encoding.

=head2 parse_entry

    my %values = parse_entry ($line);

Parse one line of Kanjidic. The input is one line from Kanjidic,
encoded as Unicode. The return value is a hash containing each field
from the line.

The possible keys and values of the returned hash are as
follows. Values are scalars unless otherwise mentioned.

I<on'yomi> readings are in katakana, as per Kanjidic itself. It is
encoded in Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

The following example prints a list of kanji which have the same on'yomi:

    binmode STDOUT, ":utf8";

                push @{$all_onyomi{$o}}, $k;
            }
        }
    }
    for my $o (sort keys %all_onyomi) {
        if (@{$all_onyomi{$o}} > 1) {
            print "Same onyomi 「$o」 for 「@{$all_onyomi{$o}}」!\n";
        }
    }


=item kunyomi

This is an array reference which contains the I<kun'yomi> (訓読) of
the kanji. (See
L<http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kanji-pronunciation.html>.) It may be

has the following keys.

=over

=item volume

The volume number of the character.

=back

If there is no information, this remains unset.

For example, to print all the existing values,

    
    use Data::Kanji::Kanjidic 'parse_kanjidic';

    my $kanji = parse_kanjidic ("/path/to/kanjidic");
    for my $k (sort keys %$kanji) {
        my $mo = $kanji->{$k}->{morohashi};
        if ($mo) {
            print "$k: volume $mo->{volume}, page $mo->{page}, index $mo->{index}.\n";
        }
    }
    


=back

For detailed explanations of these codes, see L</Kanjidic>.

=head2 kanjidic_order

    kanjidic_order ($kanjidic_ref);

Return a list sorted by stroke order of the elements of
C<\%kanjidic>. Also add the field "kanji_id" to each of them so that
the order can be reconstructed when referring to elements.

=head2 grade

    my $grade2 = grade ($kanjidic_ref, 2);

Given a school grade such as C<2> above, and the return value of
L</parse_kanjidic>, C<$kanjidic_ref>, return an array reference
